They have information about medications for types of disorders; however, this information might be a little too scientific/medical for people to understand. I like the Types of Therapy so people can see what may help them when looking for a psychologist. The thing to note that this is not an exhaustive list. It just has the common types of therapy. The concern I have is for the information and statistics for the Challenges and Disorders section. No research citations and the statistics I have seen are different but I am not sure if they are showing Canadian numbers, worldwide numbers, US, etc. I would be a little cautious when reading some of the statistics.
